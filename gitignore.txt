Ignoring Specific Files and Directories

To ignore a specific file, provide the full path from the root of the project:

/text.txt
To ignore a directory and its contents, include the directory name with a trailing slash:

test/
To ignore all files with a specific name, use the file name alone:

text.txt
To ignore files with a specific extension, use a wildcard pattern:

*.md
To make exceptions for specific files, use the negating pattern with an exclamation mark:

*.md
!README.md
This pattern will ignore all .md files except README.md
